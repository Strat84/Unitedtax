Careers at UnitedTax.AI
Help Us Build the Future of Finance, One App at a Time.
Weâ€™re not building just another fintech app.
Weâ€™re building a family of powerful, AI-driven financial tools â€” designed to disrupt the tax, accounting, and financial planning space. From intelligent bookkeeping to compliance automation and predictive financial insights, our mission is clear: to become the next unicorn in the AI + finance space.

And weâ€™re looking for exceptional engineers to join us on this journey.

We're Not Hiring. We're Inviting.
Weâ€™re not looking to fill seats. Weâ€™re looking for vision-aligned builders who thrive at the intersection of finance, AI, and software craftsmanship.

If youâ€™re here, itâ€™s probably because:

Youâ€™ve built scalable tech in the financial or AI space.

You think in systems, not tasks.

You care more about impact than job titles.

You want ownership â€” not just a paycheck.

This is an invitation to build something meaningful with us, not for us.

The Offer
For the right person, we offer:

âœ… Equity ownership â€” Be a true stakeholder from day one.
ðŸš« No upfront salary â€” This isnâ€™t a job. Itâ€™s a co-founding opportunity.
ðŸ”“ Unlimited upside â€” Help us win, and you win big.
ðŸ§  Technical autonomy â€” Youâ€™ll help architect the foundation of products that scale.

Weâ€™re pre-raising. Weâ€™re post-idea. And weâ€™re shipping. Fast.

What Weâ€™re Building
Our products revolve around:

AI-powered tax automation

Bookkeeping and compliance software

Financial insights and analytics dashboards

B2B and B2C SaaS tools for small businesses and tax pros

Think: the next evolution of tools like QuickBooks, TurboTax, and Bench â€” with modern AI at the core.

Tech Stack Preferences
Weâ€™re primarily working in:

TypeScript

Python

Node.js

Vue.js

React

If you have deep experience with these technologies and an understanding of financial platforms, youâ€™ll feel right at home.

Bonus if youâ€™ve worked with:
Open Banking APIs, Stripe, AWS Lambda, FinTech security standards, or LLM integrations.

Who We're Looking For
We will not consider everyone.
Weâ€™re looking for builders, not tourists. Specifically:

Full-stack developers with 5+ years experience in product environments

Engineers whoâ€™ve shipped financial, compliance, or AI products

People who move fast, think like owners, and care about quality

Collaborators with strong communication and initiative

If thatâ€™s you â€” and you're ready to be a core part of something big â€” we want to meet you.

Sound Like You?

We donâ€™t care about rÃ©sumÃ©s. We care about real work and real vision.
